### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# I'm Sergio Cera

I work at RDR architectes, a leading architectural firm that creates innovative and sustainable solutions for complex architectural challenges. I value collaboration, creativity, and curiosity, and I strive to bring diverse perspectives and experiences to the team.

I analyze complex datasets, uncover valuable insights, and use storytelling to help clients understand the impact of architectural decisions, enhancing project value and success. I develop advanced tools to streamline these processes. I also leverage my background as architect and quantity surveyor to provide a broad perspective on project costs, feasibility, optimization, sustainability, durability, and lifecycle considerations. I enjoy working with architects, seamlessly integrating both the project development and design processes, and contributing to the firm's vision of creating human-centric and resilient cities.

## Embracing the Future of Architecture

In our architectural endeavours, we often face significant challenges when it comes to organizing classifications and object clusters. The current method of configuring requirements demands a laborious, step-by-step selection process for object types, attributes, and relationships.

We recognize the pressing need for a more efficient approach!

Consequently, I am in the ongoing process of developing software designed to streamline this intricate task. There is a significant opportunity to leverage advanced technology to empower architects with digital tools for efficiently managing this complex dataset, where the intricacies of the processes are abstracted away by user-friendly interfaces.

If you resonate with our vision and would like to explore collaboration, please don't hesitate to get in touch.
