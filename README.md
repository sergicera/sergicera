# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

In the industry, the key lies in optimizing and automating tasks to maximize value creation. I am passionate about designing innovative and disruptive solutions that integrate multidisciplinary skills to tackle this challenge. My primary focus is on analyzing design in the early phases to gain a better understanding of the project and facilitate informed decision-making. I'm also interseted in managing complexity in more advanced stages of project development. With my experience in architecture, data science, machine learning, and more, I have developed technologies that demonstrate this capability. Now, I seek to join forces with visionary professionals to bring this project to fruition and turn obstacles into opportunities.

If you resonate with this vision and would like to explore collaboration, please don't hesitate to get in touch.
